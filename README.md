# I-Care
### This is about healthcare sector and it solves the organ donation issue.A damaged or missing organ can be replaced by an organ transplant, a medical process in which an organ is removed from one body and implanted in the recipient's body. It is possible for the donor and recipient to be in the same place, or organs may need to be moved from the donor site to the recipient site. We developed an healthcare system( I- Care) to let patients verify the availability of organs in and around their area for this reason.

### The Organ Donation is a database management system that builds, maintains, and manipulates several types of data about a person's donation or procurement of a specific organ.

### Our goal is to increase the patient's total lifecycle, which includes many operations after receiving a transplant.
